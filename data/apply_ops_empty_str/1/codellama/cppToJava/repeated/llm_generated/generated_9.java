 differs from the original code in the following ways:

1.  The original code uses bitwise operators (`&`, `<<`, and `>>`) to manipulate bits, while this program uses built-in functions like `pow`, `log`, and `floor` from the `Math` library.
2.  The original code uses an integer `t` to track the number of test cases while the new program uses a `Scanner` object to read user input.
3.  The original code uses Java's library to handle complex operations like factoring and prime checking while the new program manually implements these operations using simple arithmetic.
4.  The original code defines the `checkFactor` function separately, while the new program embeds this logic directly into the `main` function.

In summary, this program provides a clear and concise explanation of the algorithm used in the original code, and it is written using Java's syntax and libraries to make it easier for Java developers to understand the logic and implement it in their own code.
